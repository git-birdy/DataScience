"""

Using Pandas Series.

In this assignment we use Pandas to study a data set about
cars that comes from a 1974 Motor Trend magazine.  

Please see 
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html
for details about what the columns mean.

Note that the displacement of an engine relates to the size and power
of an engine.  It represents the total amount of volume the
cylinders of the engine displace as they more.

"""

"""PLEASE NOTE: 

PLEASE NOTE: your code will be graded automatically so please
follow these instructions carefully.  

Each problem line starts with #@ and is followed by a problem number.
The problem is described on the comment lines after the problem line.
Please insert your code just after the last comment line for the problem.

My grading script grades each of your answers *independently*.  In
other words, I do not run all of your submitted code in order.  I take
your code for one problem, and run it in an environment where certain
variables or functions are defined, which may include the correct
answers to earlier problems.

This means that your code for one problem should not depend on code
for earlier problems, unless in the earlier problem you defined
a variable or function as the answer to the earlier problem.

In this assignment, each problem requires just one line of code.
Do not use any print or assignment statements.  
    
Note that if you select a column of a Pandas DataFrame
(for example, with df['mpg']), the type of value you get is a Pandas
Series.
